      <section id='about'>
        <p>I am a rising Senior (4th year) studying Mechanical Engineering at the <a href='https://www.nd.edu/'>University of Notre Dame</a>, where I am a <a href='https://cuse.nd.edu/sorin-scholars/'>Sorin Scholar</a>.<br>
	<br>I enjoy the pursuit of sophisticated — yet elegant — solutions to mechanical design problems. I seek to apply my knowledge of materials, manufacturing, and design to build wonderful things.<br>
	<br>I have already had some incredible opportunities to do this in the past — I am currently interning at <a href='https://prattwhitney.com'>Pratt & Whitney</a> as a manufacturing engineer in the additive manufacturing R&D lab. I have previously interned at nuTonomy (now <a href='https://motional.com'>Motional</a>) in Singapore and worked as an undergraduate researcher at the <a href='https://irislab.nd.edu/'>Innovative Robotics and Interactive Systems Lab</a> (IRIS Lab) at Notre Dame. <br>
          <br>In my free time, I enjoy reading and listening to a wide variety of music. I am currently in the process of rediscovering my love for playing the piano.
