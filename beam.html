               <h4>Summary</h4>
               <p>As part of a small team, I designed a structural beam out of foam board, capable of sustaining loads of up to 123 lbf (~547 N).</p>

               <h4>Detailed Breakdown</h4>
               <p>The main project in this course was to build a beam capable of supporting the maximum possible load in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_flexural_test#/media/File:Three_point_flexural_test.jpg">three-point flexural bending test</a>. My partner and I agreed to base our design on a standard I-beam due to its ‚Äòtried and tested‚Äô realability and its status as the industry standard for structural beams.</p>
               <br>
               <p>We were provided with only a single 10x40x0.19‚Äù sheet of foam board and four glue sticks for construction. This constraint on materials made the task challenging.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Once we agreed on an I-beam-based, the challenge quickly became about figuring out how to optimize the given material for strength. Using the general formula for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flexural_strength#Measuring_flexural_strength">flexural bending stress</a>, and recognizing the fact that the applied moment and height above the neutral axis cannot be controlled in this experiment, we quickly realized that the best way to minimize bending stress is by maximizing the area moment of inertia (denoted <b><i>I</i></b> ). We computed <b><i>I</i></b> &nbsp;for various flange width and stem height combinations, keeping in mind that height has the greatest impact on maximizing <b><i>I</i></b>&nbsp; and thus minimizing the bending stress, ùúé, for a given force. We constrained each attempt by the dimensions of the foam board in order to ensure continuous use of the entire width of the foam board. The dimensions which yielded the highest  <b><i>I</i></b>&nbsp; were used to cut the board into three pieces (vertical stem and two flanges). 70 square inches of excess material remained, which we decided to use for additional supports. To inform our placement of these supports, we generated shear-force and bending-moment diagrams for the 3-point loading configuration.</p>

               <p class='caption'>Shear force diagram for a beam undergoing 3-point bending. The x-axis represents the length spanned by the beam (0-33 inches), and the y-axis is the magnitude of the shear force experienced by the beam assuming a load of 100 lbf being applied in the center.</p>

               <p><br><br>The plots clearly indicate that the maximum support is needed towards the center of the beam, near where the load is applied. Given the remaining material, we cut fourteen vertical 0.5x6x0.19 inch supports to match the height of the I-beam. On each side of the beam, we placed five supports concentrated in the middle, as well as one halfway to each end of the beam for additional torsional support. A drawing of the CAD model for the initial design is shown below.</p>
               <br>
               <div class='fig'>
                  <img id='beam_1' src='media/beam_1.jpg'>

               <p class='caption'>Initial design of the beam. The unused material was used to create two horizontal layers of padding to cushion and distribute the pressure applied by the downward loading. This padding is seen in middle of the topmost face.</p>
               <br><br>
               <p>We then produced a physical prototype of the design, using exacto knives to cut sections out of the foam board and hot glue to secure components together (strictly enforced as the only permitted materials in the challenge). My partner and I thought we came up with an innovative way to strengthen the construction, which was by cutting grooves and slots into surfaces to allow components to 'puzzle fit' into one another, rather than relying solely on the glue to adhere two flat surfaces together. With our method, the structure would ‚Äì in theory ‚Äì become stronger as force was applied to it, due to the fact that the applied force effectively embeds the components deeper inside one another rather than shearing them against one another. In reality, however, even slight imperfections in the grooves (e.g. contact points being even a few degrees off from perfect perpendicularity) severely weakened those points of the structure and made it prone to lateral torsional buckling (LTB).</p><br><br>

                  <img class='figure' src='media/beam_1_fail.jpg'>
               </div>
               <p class='caption'>The constructed beam was placed in a three-point bending test setup as shown on the left. It successfully supported a load of 97.6 lbf before failing due to LTB as seen on the right.</p>
               <br><br>
               <p>We had not anticipated this failure mode; all design focus had been on bolstering structural support around the middle region. The grooves cut in the flange and stem panels contributed to the beam failing in LTB, as they unintentionally caused beam to twist unpredictably. To address this issue, the major design changes we made for the second iteration were (1) we did not carve grooves into the plates and (2) we added gussets of varying sizes along the length of the beam to act as additional supports to discourage failure through LTB. We accomplished this by reallocating some the of material used on flat-lying plates on the top of the beam.</p>

               </div>
               <p class='caption'>A drawing of the revised beam design. The main strut supports are still present but gussets have been added to provide support against LTB.</p>

               <p class='caption'>The revised prototype of the beam, shown before and after being subjected to significant loading. LTB is clearly visible as the beam twists about its lateral axis. This version of the beam was able to support a load of 123.0 lbf (a 26% increase in load bearing ability from the original prototype) before experiencing failure.</p>
               <br><br>
               <p>The beam still failed in LTB, though it should be noted that the gussets certainly functioned as expected. They kept the connections between the stem & flange plates almost perfectly perpendicular, in contrast to what was seen in the first test. As such, when the beam failed in the second trial, it was due to the material in the vertical stem plate ‚Äúwrinkling‚Äù, rather than the plate connections getting twisted.</p>
