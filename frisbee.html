               <h4>Summary:</h4>
               <p>As part of a small team, I designed and built a table-mounted rotating arm frisbee launcher.</p>

               <h4>In-Depth Breakdown:</h4>
               <p>For the final project in this course, we were tasked with designing a platform capable of launching a small handheld aircraft. The only engineering constraints we were given were that the unit must mount onto a table provided by our professor, and that only component which could be manufactured using additive techniques was the aircraft itself. The exact form of the aircraft was left unspecified, so the first step of the design process was to decide on this, as the overall approach for the design would vary greatly depending on the aircraft type. We brainstormed a few simple aircraft & launcher forms and evaluated the validity of each using simple <b>decision matrices</b>. The decision matrix used for the aircraft type is shown below.</p>

               <p class='caption'>The decision matrix generated to help select the design of the aircraft. The frisbee design is the clear winner.</p>
               <p>
                  </br>Once the general category of the launcher was determined to be a frisbee/disc launcher design (as opposed to a linear glider aircraft launcher), we discussed several possible frisbee launcher types, including a rubber band-powered launcher, a linear spring-driven rail system, a torsional-spring based rotating arm design, and more. Eventually, we settled on the rotating arm design, influenced in part by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0_U1FHwACk">Mark Rober's Rock-Skipping Robot</a>. This design was selected due to its ability to <b>reliably and repeatably</b> deliver the rotational energy required for stable disc flight.<br>
                  <br>We came up with a design which we defined by four main subassemblies: the table mounting rig, the angle adjustment mechanism, the mechanical power (torque) storage & delivery unit, and the swinging arm (which holds and releases the frisbee). I was personally responsible for modeling the table-mount system, though design and construction of the four subassemblies was done by all five team members.
               </p>
               <br>
               <p> In total, we modeled approximately 25 individual components for the various mechanisms and subassemblies. We made engineering drawings for each one. I have selected a handful of drawings and CAD screenshots from the project to show below.</p>

               <p class='caption'>Isolated view of the bearing block subassembly, which contains the trigger mechanism as well as the torsional spring which powers the swinging arm. The horizontal brass locking pin in the L-shaped trigger piece slides out, causing the trigger arm to rotate out of the plane of motion of the launch arm, thereby allowing it to swing freely and launch the projectile. All of the energy stored in the loaded torsional spring is released in a short timeframe during the launch.</p>

               <p>After extensive adjustment and refinement of the design, a physical prototype was constructed.</p>

               <br><br>
               <p>The final prototype matched the design incredibly well. The only major change which was made during construction was the length of the launch arm, which was gradually shortened through empirical trials to optimize for launch distance and release position. Our prototype was able to consistently launch the frisbee ~20 feet, and the disc was one of only two aircraft in the class to achieve sustained flight.</p>
