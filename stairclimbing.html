               <h4>In-Depth Breakdown:</h4>
               <p>For the final project in this course, we were challenged to build a stair-climbing robot which would be capable of carrying a payload of two 7.5oz (mini) soda cans up the stairs with minimal disturbance or shaking of the cargo. It was explicitly specified that the soda container needed to be remotely openable and closable via a servo-actuated mechanism.<br>
                  <br>Each subassembly of the final robot assembly was led by one team member, with the rest of the group providing feedback about the design as well as helping hands-on with the manufacturing and assembly of the individual components. As such, <b>I was personally responsible for the design and manufacturing of the soda box</b>.<br>
                  <br>For the design of the drivebase, we started by brainstorming a few several possible designs. Each member submitted a rough sketch of their idea, and the team evaluated them together, taking note of design features that could potentially be included in the final design. Two of the most popular design ideas are shown below.

               </div>
               <p class='caption'>An initial drawing of the semi-circle wheel design.</p>
               <p></br>We evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of each based on previous implementations of each design (eg. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB4nj6NUKVE'>Seoul National University’s rapid stair climbing build</a> and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46qEgN3eqkA'>a senior design project from Trine University</a>), and ultimately decided that the four-wheeled semicircle approach offers the most linear motion.</p>
               <p><br>We then constructed a simplified model of the robot (with approximately semi-circular wheels) and staircase environment, and conducted motion analysis of three different motors: a <a href='https://www.servocity.com/20-rpm-precision-spur-gear-motor/'>20 RPM</a>, <a href='https://www.gobilda.com/5203-series-yellow-jacket-planetary-gear-motor-188-1-ratio-24mm-length-8mm-rex-shaft-30-rpm-3-3-5v-encoder/'>30 RPM</a>, and <a href='https://www.servocity.com/content/downloads/45_rpm_hd_precision_planetary_gearmotor_-_specifications.pdf'>45 RPM</a>. The 30 RPM motor (planetary gearbox with 188:1 gear ratio) was the only one of the three tested motors which provided the torque necessary to overcome the height of each stair, so we opted to use it to drive our belt and pulley power transmission system. This high gear ratio means high torque at the expense of RPM — a necessary tradeoff for this particular application.<br></p>

               <br><br>
               <p>As for the evolution of the wheel design, measurements of the stairs dictated that the arc length of each semicircle of the wheel needed to be approximately 311 mm to maximize wheel contact with each step of the stair. Motion analysis proved that the arc length of the wheel needed to be approximately 327 mm to minimize the motion of the robot in the y-direction, thereby creating the most linear and stable path of travel. The wheel geometry went through numerous design iterations, and eventually evolved into a shape defined by a parametric curve of changing radius, allowing the wheel to seamlessly roll over the stairs when placed in the correct starting position. The final drawing of the wheel is shown below.</p>

               <br> 
               <p>The drivetrain was designed to directly power both axles directly via a belt and pulley system, in order to ensure that the wheels are always in phase when operating — a key assumption upon which our motion analysis (and therefore wheel design) was based. The subassembly is shown below.</p>

               <br>
               <p> The soda box was designed to house the cans inside a sock-absorbing foam block, which cushions the soda cans from the minor remaining shaking and bumpiness of the robot body. It operates with a rear-mounted servo, which pulls down the lever arm on the back of the soda box lid to open the container. </p>

               <p>Once the design of all of the main subassemblies and components was finalized, the robot was assembled in the configuration shown below. Note that the battery and wireless recievers are not included in the model.</p>

               <br>
               <br>
               <p>We did not account for the weight of the cargo or battery in the simplified model of the robot used in initial motion analysis. This led to some imbalance issues and “flopping” behavior of the robot during testing of the initial physical prototype. The discrepancy between simulation and actual behavior showed us firsthand the perils of oversimplifying physical systems during simulation  — one of the most valuable lessons I learned through this project.<br> 
                  <br>Luckily, our motor was powerful enough to supply the torque needed to overcome this added, previously unaccounted-for weight. We did, however, face some issues with the slipperiness of the HDPE wheels, which, under the added weight, had trouble gripping the surface of the stairs, causing the whole robot to slide down the stairs. We addressed the weight distribution problem by repositioning the bulky battery on the body until we were satisfied with the stability of the robot. We addressed the sliding problem by adding a layer of anti-slip rubber tape to the outer rims of the wheels. These two solutions were enough to resolve the stability and grip challenges were were facing.<br>
                  <br>Our final robot, shown below, performed well. As stipulated in the original challenge statement, on demonstration day, the soda cans were successfully transported up the staircase and were accessed and opened without violent fizzing or exploding.
