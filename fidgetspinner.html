               <h4>Summary</h4>
               <p>I individually designed and generated the CNC tool paths for a fidget spinner toy. I then assembled a physical prototype.</p>

               <h4>Detailed Breakdown</h4>
               <p>The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with <b>computer aided manufacturing (CAM)</b>. I was provided by my professor with 0.25” HDPE stock, a single 0.35” deep bearing, 1/4-20 hex nuts for weights, and plastic finger pads; given these materials, I was tasked with designing and manufacturing a fidget spinner.<br>
                  <br>It is important to consider what the desired behavior of a fidget spinner looks like — high rotational speed, long spin duration, or a unique artistic design are some of the possible directions which can inform the design of such a device. I decided that it was important that my device be optimized for rotational speed. As such, my design was motivated by the idea of concentrating a large amount of mass very close to the center of rotation so as to create a relatively small mass moment of inertia. To achieve this, I decided to place six ‘weights’ (steel nuts) in a ring immediately surrounding the finger pads. For geometric consistency, the outer shell of the device was also designed to be hexagonal.<br> 
                  <br>I created a model based on this idea, with holes toleranced to allow the steel weighting nuts to be <b>press-fit</b> into their holes. I added additional circular holes near the outer edge of the fidget spinner to shift the weight distribution to be concentrated even nearer to the center hole.</p>

               <p><br>Once the model was finalized, I specified the milling operations (just <b>open pockets</b> and a <b>perimeter</b> feature for this part) and generated the tool paths. I then generated the <b>G-code</b> and set the procedure to run on a <a href='https://www.haascnc.com/machines/desktop-machines/desktop-mill.html'>Haas desktop mill</a>. The final result is shown below.</p>
