               <h4>Summary</h4>
               <p>Mentored by two senior engineers, I designed and conducted experiments to quantitatively study the performance of various hole threading techniques in additively manufactured polymer parts.</p>

               <h4>Detailed Breakdown</h4>
               <p>As a manufacturing engineering intern in <a href='https://www.prattwhitney.com/en/newsroom/news/2024/07/24/additive-manufacturing'>Pratt & Whitney’s Additive Manufacturing R&D Lab</a>, I led an initiative to further the lab’s understanding of threaded holes in polymer parts for use with fasteners. Since polymer materials vary significantly in mechanical and thermal properties, it is important to quantifiably know which technique (e.g., printed threads, pre-threaded metal inserts, or manual tapping) is most appropriate for a given application. To investigate this, I designed and printed test parts for a range of materials and geometries. I created a database summarizing my findings, which includes A- and B-basis material allowables, confidence intervals for spinout & failure torques, media of trials & failure modes, and detailed design guides for internal use.<br>
	       <br>Unfortunately, as per the terms of my contract, I am unable to publish findings, media, or any further information about the context of this work.</p>
