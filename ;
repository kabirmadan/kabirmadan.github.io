               <h4>Detailed Breakdown</h4>
               <p>For the final project in this course, our class was challenged to build a stair-climbing robot which would be capable of carrying a payload of two 7.5oz (mini) soda cans with minimal disturbance or shaking of the cargo. One of the stipulations was that the soda container needed to be remotely openable and closable via a servo-actuated mechanism. <b>I was personally responsible for the design and manufacturing of this soda box</b>. Our group started by brainstorming several possible designs; two early ideas are shown below.<br>

               <p class='caption'>A sketch of a tri-spoke wheel design, with a dragging 'tail'. This design ended up being very popular among other teams.</p>

               </div>
               <p class='caption'>An initial drawing of the semi-circle wheel design.</p>
               <p></br>Our team evaluated the strengths of each design based on previous implementations (eg. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB4nj6NUKVE'>Seoul National University’s rapid stair climbing build</a> and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46qEgN3eqkA'>a senior design project from Trine University</a>), and ultimately decided that the four-wheeled semicircle approach offered the most linear motion.</p>
               <p><br>We then constructed a simplified model of the robot (with approximately semi-circular wheels) and staircase environment, and conducted motion analysis three motors varying in speed: a <a href='https://www.servocity.com/20-rpm-precision-spur-gear-motor/'>20 RPM</a>, <a href='https://www.gobilda.com/5203-series-yellow-jacket-planetary-gear-motor-188-1-ratio-24mm-length-8mm-rex-shaft-30-rpm-3-3-5v-encoder/'>30 RPM</a>, and <a href='https://www.servocity.com/content/downloads/45_rpm_hd_precision_planetary_gearmotor_-_specifications.pdf'>45 RPM</a>. The 30 RPM motor (planetary gearbox with 188:1 gear ratio) was the only one of the three tested motors which provided the torque necessary to overcome the height of each stair, so we opted to use it to drive our belt and pulley power transmission system. Of course, the increased torque came at the expense of RPM — a tradeoff we deemed necessary for our given application.<br></p>

               <p class='caption'>Motion analysis of the 30 RPM motor configuration. Note that the wheel geometry used here was still in its early design phase.</p>
               <br><br>
               <p>In refining the design of the wheel, we measured the dimensions of a representative staircase to determine the arc length of each semicircle of the wheel. We found that it needed to be approximately 311 mm to allow the rolling wheels to maintain full contact with each step. led us to the conclusion that we could create a more stable path of travel by minimizing movement in the y-axis plane by slightly increasing the wheel size. As such, we increased the wheel arc-length to 327 mm. We iterated on this geometry several times, and eventually settled on a shape defined by a parametric curve of changing radius to counterbalance the fact that the robot body’s height relative to the stairs naturally oscillated over traversal cycles. The final drawing of the wheel is shown below.</p>

               <br>
               <br> 
               <p>We designed the drivetrain to directly power both axles directly via a belt and pulley system, in order to ensure that the wheels are always in phase when operating — a key assumption upon which our motion analysis (and therefore wheel design) was based. The subassembly is shown below.</p>

               <br>
               <p> I designed the soda box to house the cans inside a shock-absorbing foam block, which cushions the soda cans from the minor remaining shaking and bumpiness of the robot body. It operates with a rear-mounted servo, which pulls down the lever arm on the back of the soda box lid to open the container. </p>

               <br>
               <p>Once my team had finalized the design of all of the main subassemblies and components, we assembled the robot in the configuration shown below. Note that the battery and wireless recievers are not included in the model.</p>

               <br>
               <br>
               <p>We did not account for the weight of the cargo or battery in the simplified model of the robot used in our initial motion analysis. This led to some imbalance issues and “flopping” behavior of the robot during testing of the initial physical prototype. The discrepancy between simulation and actual behavior showed us firsthand the perils of oversimplifying physical systems during simulation  — one of the most valuable lessons I learned through this project.<br> 
                  <br>Luckily, our motor was powerful enough to supply the torque needed to overcome this added, previously unaccounted-for weight. We did, however, face some challenges with the slipperiness of the HDPE wheels, which, under the added weight, had trouble gripping the surface of the stairs, causing the whole robot to slide down the stairs. We addressed the weight distribution problem by repositioning the bulky battery on the body until we were satisfied with the stability of the robot. Our team solved the sliding problem by adding a layer of anti-slip rubber tape to the outer rims of the wheels. These two solutions were enough to resolve the stability and grip issues.<br>
                  <br>Our final robot, shown below, performed well. As stipulated, on demonstration day, the soda cans were successfully transported up the staircase and were accessed & opened without violent fizzing or exploding. I made a short video of the project (just for fun), which you can check out <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcW0CZObqnw'>here</a>.</p>
